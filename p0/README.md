* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of
sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this
right from the project specification. I don't want you to just cut and
paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

The purpose of this program is to establish and get familiarized with a working
programming environment to be used for this CS 253 class.

## Personal Goal

Creating goals for your future achievement is an important component
of human motivation and satisfaction. Create a one or two sentence goal for 
yourself in CS253 this semester to help motivate you!

Here are some examples to help you get started brainstorming.

* Understand what on earth ```char **argv``` means.
* Complete each project!
* Master low level computer programming!
* Submit a project with no memory leaks!
* I just want to pass!

There are several goals I have in mind, in particular my experience
and proficency with java is still very shaky so I'm hoping expanding into
C will help with improving with proficiency in java as they appear to
have similar structures.  I'm also interested in getting proficient in
programming in general before doing a study abroad program later this 
year or next year.

## Results 

This section presents timing and other results of the experiments that 
you were asked to perform as part of the project.

All the print statements seem to work, however I didn't hear any noises
from the bell character when running the program.

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
